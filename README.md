# PHES_Honors_Thesis_Code
Pumped-Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) is a well-established energy generation technology with over 20 GW of installed generation capacity currently in the US. The main benefit of PHES is the additional flexibility and reliability it offers the grid. Grid variability caused by high levels of renewable generation sources can be mitigated through the integration of PHES. 
When operated alongside wind farms, a PHES plant can exploit the rejected or excess wind energy which is stored as potential energy in the form of water pumped to an elevated reservoir. 
This paper explores the relationship between high levels onshore and offshore wind penetration with PHES.  A computational model simulates the operation of a PHES facility in the electricity system. The results obtained indicate that introducing PHES into an electricity grid with high penetration of wind energy can result in increased capacity factors of wind generation technologies. With PHES, offshore wind in New England increases its capacity factor from 7% to 21%.


In this code we are implenting a pumped hydro storage facility into an electricity model.
